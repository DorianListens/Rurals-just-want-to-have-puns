Following the (excellent) guide by [gabebw](https://github.com/gabebw): [How to Learn a New Programming Language]( http://gabebw.com/blog/2015/10/24/how-to-learn-a-new-programming-language)

#Usage

`$ cargo run` will run the application with the default pun word "Heart".

`$ cargo run #{word}` will run with whatever word you provide.

Critique is both welcome and desired.
